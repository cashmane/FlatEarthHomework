# FlatEarthHomework
Run ellipse_area.py will run calculations and print out the value for the 1d integral and the masked 2d integral.
Run roundEarth.py will run calculations and print out the grav acceleration vectors at the north pole, south pole, and equator.
Run flatEarth.py will run calculations and print out grav acceleration vectors at north pole, south pole, and equator. It will also
show the plot of the grav acceleration for different heights above the north pole of the flat earth.
